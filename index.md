# Livestreaming

1. **Check your cell phone coverage in your area.** I found my T-Mobile signal (Google Fi) was too unreliable. There were days where streaming was flawless and other times there were constant live stream disconnects. Recently, I ended up switching to Xfinity Mobile because it is a Verizon reseller, which seems to have better coverage in my area. AT&T would be the ideal but Xfinity Mobile has a deal for $40/device for 2 people for Comcast subscribers.
2. **Verify that heat isn't an issue** - if your phone is overheating, it will shut down the circuitry to protect itself. You should see a warning message on your phone about it, and you'll need to add a fan or some type of heat sink.
3. **You could reduce the quality from 720p to 480p** ([article](https://teammanager.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/8783986265357-Monitor-Network-Health-While-Broadcasting-Video). Video streaming requires a constant bit rate, and if it drops below a certain level, you will get disconnects.
4. **Check your data plan limits** - often carriers claim unlimited plans, but it turns out you are capped on a certain amount of bandwidth consumed. There is usually caveats especially on tethering your phone (often 5GB/month). Once you past the limit the carriers will throttle your bandwidth consumption, which makes it almost impossible to livestream.
5. **Add cell phone carrier redundancy** (most expensive but most reliable route) - I took a suggestion from this group and paid for a pre-paid AT&T card (an unlimited prepaid monthly for $50/mo). Google Pixel devices supports dual SIMs, so presumably you can use it to connect to both cell services at the same time (e.g. work/personal phone). I chose to use an older phone and hotspot it as a Wifi for my main Android phone. But Speedify, which monitors the live streaming connection, and switches seemlessly between cell phone numbers, solved all my reliability problems.
